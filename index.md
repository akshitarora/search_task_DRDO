# Research Overview

Many developed nations are increasingly seeking out video game technology (like, 3D games, Virtual Reality (VR)) to train soldiers. These games attempt to simulate the experience of an army soldier in a variety of military scenarios. However, the scope of these simulations is limited to a virtual world. For simulating interaction with the physical world, we propose to use augmented reality (AR) for military training. 

AR is a technique that enables the users to interact with their physical environment through an overlay of a virtual world. First, a survey of existing AR developer tools and technologies has been discussed. Second, various military scenarios have been discussed and developed using Vuforia and Unity 3D. Third, the design of experiments with AR and VR in context of cognitive modelling and use of NeuLog sensors has been described. Furthermore, applications of AR in other domains like education, shopping, etc. have been discussed. Experiments were also conducted at ACS lab.

During the course of internship, two projects were carried out:
- To test a personâ€™s memory power under different cognitive loading conditions. My part in the project was to develop a specific loading condition that corresponds to AR (HMD based video see-through solution). {Refer to Demo Link 1}
- To make a first person shooter (FPS) game in AR. (Incomplete). {Refer to Demo Link 2}
